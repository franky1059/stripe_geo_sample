Stripe configuration is stored in config.php
Charge logs are stored in data/_data.csv


Notes and Comments:
I made a pretty standard MVC app to process templates and localize funcionality to specific actions.
Some todo's I wanted to do but didn't have time for...
	- make subclasses for each action
	- make a "payments handler" that would make it possible to easilty interchange payment processor vendors (pretty much a paynents factory class)
	- make a order serializer handler
I think you'll get the idea of what I was going for. Let me know if any questions!
